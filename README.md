Some java programs I created while practicing
Java Programs:
1) Library - a program, which stores information of books. A user can add a new book, view list of available books, delete a book or search for a particular book. There are also some screenshots of program performance provided in the folder "Testing".
2) DraggingAndDrawing - a program, which allows a user to draw points and drag them within the window. The program also displays coordinates of a hovering point.
